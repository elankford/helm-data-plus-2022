# HELM Data+ Project

## Overview
The HELM project aims detect archaeological features of medieval Irish settlements using aerial imagery within the modern Irish landscape. The project can be broken down into two main stages: using visualization techniques to enhance present features and developing a method for automatic feature detection.

Using aerial imagery via drones is cost-effective and efficient compared to traditional archaeological fieldwork. We used images of locations across Ireland, reconstructed as digital terrain models (DTMs), and visualized them to locate low-lying medieval features in the landscape such as burgage plots and ridge and furrows. We subsequently implemented and trained an image segmentation model to attempt automatic feature detection.
